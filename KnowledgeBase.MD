# 2 - Customers Who Never Order
~~~
Table: Customers

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
 

Table: Orders

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 

Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

# 3 - Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders
~~~
Table: Orders

+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
 

Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.
~~~

### Answer - 

````sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(order_number) DESC
LIMIT 1;
