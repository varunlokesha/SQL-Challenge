# 2 - Customers Who Never Order
~~~
Table: Customers

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |

# 3 - Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders
~~~
Table: Orders

+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
 

Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.
~~~

### Answer - 

````sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(order_number) DESC
LIMIT 1;

# 4 - Big Countries
~~~
Table: World

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+

| population  | int     |
| gdp         | int     |
+-------------+---------+
name is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
 

A country is big if:

it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
World table:
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+

# 5 - Combine Two Tables
~~~
Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key column for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
 

Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
 

Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----------+----------+-----------+
| personId | lastName | firstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
+----------+----------+-----------+
Address table:
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
Explanation: 
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.
~~~

### Answer - 

````sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName, A.city, A.state
FROM Address A
RIGHT JOIN Person P on P.personId = A.personId;

# 6 - Top Travellers
~~~
Table: Users

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
name is the name of the user.
 

Table: Rides

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| distance      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
user_id is the id of the user who traveled the distance "distance".
 

Write an SQL query to report the distance traveled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by travelled_distance in descending order, if two or more users traveled the same distance, order them by their name in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+------+-----------+
| id   | name      |
+------+-----------+
| 1    | Alice     |
| 2    | Bob       |
| 3    | Alex      |
| 4    | Donald    |
| 7    | Lee       |
| 13   | Jonathan  |
| 19   | Elvis     |
+------+-----------+
Rides table:
+------+----------+----------+
| id   | user_id  | distance |
+------+----------+----------+
| 1    | 1        | 120      |
| 2    | 2        | 317      |
| 3    | 3        | 222      |
| 4    | 7        | 100      |
| 5    | 13       | 312      |
| 6    | 19       | 50       |
| 7    | 7        | 120      |
| 8    | 19       | 400      |
| 9    | 7        | 230      |
+------+----------+----------+
Output: 
+----------+--------------------+
| name     | travelled_distance |
+----------+--------------------+
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
+----------+--------------------+
Explanation: 
Elvis and Lee traveled 450 miles, Elvis is the top traveler as his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
Bob, Jonathan, Alex, and Alice have only one ride and we just order them by the total distances of the ride.
Donald did not have any rides, the distance traveled by him is 0.
~~~

### Answer - 

````sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT U.name, COALESCE(SUM(R.distance),0) AS travelled_distance 
FROM Users U
LEFT JOIN Rides R on U.id = R.user_id
GROUP BY U.id
ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, U.name;

| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+
Output: 
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
Explanation: 
- Math has 6 students, so we include it.
- English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.
